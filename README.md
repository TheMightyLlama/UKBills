# UKBills
A sample JSON output for UK parliament bills

The United Kingdom Government provides information on the bills which are currently going through parliament. Currently it is possible to obtain this information through RSS feeds as noted below. The JSON documents in this project propose a new structure to the data provided in the feeds which would give easier programatic access to the status of any given bill.
